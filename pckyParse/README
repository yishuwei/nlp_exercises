tree.py: A Tree class is defined in this script, which is used in grammar training and parsing. This class allows easy 
navigation within a tree by accessing the children and mother fields. It also contains methods that can generate rules 
that license the tree, that output the tree in bracketed format, and that parse the bracketed string into a Tree object.

train_grammar.py: Trains a probabilistic CFG on a treebank. It reads in all trees in the treebank, generates all rules 
that licencing them, and estimates the probability of each rule from the relative counts.

pcky.py: Reads in a probabilistic CFG in Chomsky Normal Form and a set of sentences and then yields the parse for each 
sentence with the highest probability.
